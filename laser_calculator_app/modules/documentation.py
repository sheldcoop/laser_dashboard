            "\n- **Effective Penetration Depth ($Œ±^{-1}$):** A property that describes how deeply the laser energy is absorbed to cause ablation. A *small* value (e.g., 0.1 ¬µm) means the energy is absorbed in a very shallow layer, leading to very precise, controlled removal. A *large* value means the energy soaks in deeper, leading to faster but potentially less controlled drilling."
